# Quickstart: Preview Elysion Homepage

1. Install dependencies from the repository root:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Launch the Next.js development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and review the landing page at desktop, tablet, and mobile widths.
4. Validate the responsive notes in the constitution (fixed nav, hero, services, testimonials) and document any spacing/overflow observations before marking the feature ready for Phase 2.

## Responsive QA Notes

- Hero section looks good across the 1200px+ viewport, with the CTA and headline staying visible without overflow.
- The overall page responds well: the services grid collapses nicely into fewer columns, and spacing remains consistent.
- Grid spacing feels balanced and avoids horizontal scroll on smaller breakpoints.
